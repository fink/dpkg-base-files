Description: Support scripts for dpkg
DescDetail: <<
The dpkg-base-files package contains files that dpkg uses:

 * global-deb-scripts

   * During package installation, clear the dependency_libs entry in
     all .la files being installed
     
   * On package upgrade, remove files known to be problematic on Yosemite
     (and later) in advance to avoid errors of the form:
     
 unable to make backup link of `.%p/Applications/FOO.app/Contents/PkgInfo' 
 before installing new version: Operation not permitted

<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Dependency on "dpkg that runs these scripts" needed so that
	other packages can Depends on %N and know that the scripts
	will be run.
